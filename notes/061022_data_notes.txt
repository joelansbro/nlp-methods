061022 data notes

Tonight these are some notes I took to mark down further work needed on
cleaning up text.

I know of an issue related to some titles. Titles are from the header,
not the body of the html, meaning that some title aren't as expected.
IE -> a title of comments, but the actual title is 

Software development skills for data scientists

So I have some prelim code for fixing this.


There are significant amounts of HTML entities persist in the data from the 
parser, I know this because it is present within the json batch most recently
generated for the Data_Science test dataset. This will interfere with proper
keyword collection.
IE -> writing | trey causey contains "quot" as a keyword, which is a HTML
entity fragment.
This needs cleaning.
This can be quickly sorted with the w3lib.html python package method "replace_entities"
When running through several of the content texts, this has worked a treat.

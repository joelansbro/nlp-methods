Running Sentiment analysis over a larger amount of articles today to see what we can describe


Also I forgot that running in a dataframe and describing it will return a whole range of cool things:
count	53.000000	53.0	53.0
mean	1009.377358	1.0	1.0
std	1605.028543	0.0	0.0
min	1.000000	1.0	1.0
25%	6.000000	1.0	1.0
50%	204.000000	1.0	1.0
75%	1113.000000	1.0	1.0
max	6525.000000	1.0	1.0
